Working through Colton Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp from Udemy

Started 2/14/2020

New job/moving to a new state haulted my progress in September 2020, which happened to be a good thing as the course author released a completely updated Version 2 of the course in Oct 2020.

This is to serve as an archive of my work from the v1 course.
